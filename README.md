I am a dedicated IT professional with over 3+ years of testing experience and an Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis from Niagara College. 
My knack lies in quality assurance. Skilled in programming languages, I leverage programming knowledge to bridge gaps between testing and development, working closely with cross-functional Agile teams.
My recent education has expanded my skills into software development, database management, and network security. 
Hands-on projects in client-server solutions, mobile and Windows apps, and big data security at Niagara College have strengthened my technical foundation. 
This background gives me a comprehensive perspective on QA, enhancing my contribution to the software development lifecycle.
Beyond technical skills, my experience as a coach, facilitator, and community volunteer has honed my leadership, communication, and teamwork abilities. 
Iâ€™m eager to apply my blend of QA and development skills to deliver high-quality IT solutions and drive continuous improvement in every project.
